        Here we declare necessary permissions required for the app's functionality. 
        These permissions are crucial for ensuring that the app can operate smoothly and perform its 
        intended tasks effectively.

        1. INTERNET permission is required to connect to social media platforms (like Instagram) to 
           manage messages. In practical use cases, this allows the app to send and receive messages 
           as intended while complying with platform guidelines.

        2. ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission allows the app to check the network connectivity status.
           This is essential to ensure that the app can function properly without interruptions 
           caused by network issues.

        3. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission may be added if the app needs to save any logs or 
           data files locally on the device for further analysis or scheduling tasks.
    -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />

### Explanation of the Manifest Configuration

1. **Application Configuration**:
   - The manifest starts by defining the application's package name and essential properties for identifying the application.

2. **Component Registration**:
   - **MainActivity**: Serving as the primary interface for users, allowing them to interact with the Instagram message management features.
   - **AutomationService**: A background service responsible for managing message operations, ensuring that users have 24/7 automation capabilities for managing Instagram communications without needing to manually intervene.

3. **Required Permissions**:
   - The manifest includes permissions necessary for network operations and storage access. These permissions are essential for the app’s functionality, enabling smooth operations while complying with best practices for social media management.

This configuration is intended to provide a practical framework for developing a robust social media management application using MadHub's features. The emphasis on automation and seamless operations aligns with modern user expectations for managing online interactions effectively.
