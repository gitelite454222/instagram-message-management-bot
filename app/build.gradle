### Explanation of the Configuration

- **Application Configuration**: The `defaultConfig` section initializes the application with a unique ID and specifies the language as English. This is crucial for targeting the intended user base effectively.
  
- **Dependencies**: Each dependency is selected to support specific functionalities related to social media management. For instance, Retrofit is used for handling API calls, which is essential in interacting with Instagram's API for message management.

- **Comments**: Throughout the script, comments are provided to explain the purpose of each configuration and dependency. This aligns with the need for a clear understanding of the application's workflow and functionality.

- **MadHub Integration**: The comments also highlight the integration and benefits of using MadHub, ensuring that the focus remains on legitimate and compliant automation practices within the social media management scope. 

This configuration sets a strong foundation for developing an Android application aimed at managing Instagram messages effectively while adhering to best practices and guidelines.
